# Disign:

The Disign is made from logos of bands please don't suit me for that,  the logos are probably not CC0 or something like that .  

Its not made out of a commertial intrest. 

It was made to  be rebuild in future and show whats possible on the machine 

I used Inkstitch  Addon  in  Inkscape.  

# Machiening: 

I  used the Husquana Viking Disigner Topaz30 for this project.  Its at the Attraktor Ev.  Hamburg
